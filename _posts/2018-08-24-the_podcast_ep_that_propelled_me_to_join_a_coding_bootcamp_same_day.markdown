After dreaming about learning how to code while working at several startups and websites over the start of my journalism career, I finally took the leap after listening to an episode of [The Tim Ferriss Podcast](https://tim.blog/podcast/), featuring Karlie Kloss.

Working in media, I knew Kloss as a runway and YouTube-famous supermodel. But on this hour-long podcast episode, I learned that she recently founded a free coding camp for girls called [Kode With Klossy](https://www.kodewithklossy.com).

What a cool idea. The gist of the camp founded in 2015 is empowering girls, ages 13 to 18, with scholarships to attend coding summer camps, which completely blows the door for future opportunities in tech and exposes them to growing industry where the sky's the limit.

During the interview, I related completely to what Kloss describes as a consistent interest in technology and apps. 

> "I was watching the entire world, especially fashion and media be transformed by technology, and I was like, what is it that a handful of people who are engineers and building huge enterprise value – what is the secret language that they know that the rest of us don’t, and code?," Kloss said.

When Ferriss asked why she finally learned to code and what she immediately gained from it, her answer completely pushed me to sign up for the Flatiron School's Women in Tech scholarship. 

Even with a baseline understanding of the basics of the code, "you understand high level how things are built, you can understand what is possible. And I think that that’s what’s really exciting, even just as an entrepreneur," Kloss said. 

That really resonated with me, as someone who has worked as a web producer for a major women's magazine. My role consisently included working in our company's content management system, building articles using HTML, inputting CSS code (written by someone else), and reporting bugs. I had a strong desire to learn how things work, why website features break (requiring daily/weekly bug reports to our dev team), and what the CSS code I was copying and pasting into our CMS was doing. 

Kloss also talks about feeling like an intruder, in the fashion/modeling industry, and the inner voice that says "who are you to learn to code?!" that I completely related with. But she talked about taking a week-long course at the Flatiron School in New York.

I immediately opened a new tab, and Googled "Flatiron School" and found a description of the Women's scholarship. While listening to the podcast, I filled out the scholarship form that got the ball rolling. 

I'm currently four months into Flatiron School's online full-time web stack program. It was the best decision ever!
