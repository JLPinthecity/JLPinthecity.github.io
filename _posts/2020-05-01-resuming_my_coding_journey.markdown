I recently started coding again, and I want to blog about my progress. My blog is currently down, so maybe no one will ever see this! Nonetheless, it's interesting returning to the world of programming. Things that I once new cold, I don't remember, and things that were once hard are easy. It will be really cool to  start learning again.
